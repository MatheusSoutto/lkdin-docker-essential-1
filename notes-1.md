# Introduction and Installation Prep

The course tells us to install an Ubuntu server VM, but if we use linux we can just install Docker directly (my case). In the course, they don't mention the ["Docker Desktop" edition for Linux](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/install/linux-install/), only for Windows and Mac, probably because by that time it was still not launched for linux. But now we already have that for Linux and that is recommended instead of the Docker Engine CE edition. Check the differences between the editions in this [link](https://docs.docker.com/desktop/faqs/linuxfaqs/#what-is-the-difference-between-docker-desktop-for-linux-and-docker-engine).
